CountrySelect
=============

Provides a simple helper to get an HTML select list of countries.  The list of countries comes from the ISO 3166 standard.  While it is a relatively neutral source of country names, it will still offend some users.

Users are strongly advised to evaluate the suitability of this list given their user base.

This version supports saving the country abbreviation in the database, and has abstracted the list of countries out into a Geography module. This way, you can use this list in your models:

class Address < ActiveRecord::Base

    validates_inclusion_of :country, :in => Geography::COUNTRY_CODES

end

View Example
=======

country_select("user", 'US', 'CA')
